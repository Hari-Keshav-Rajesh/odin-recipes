    <h2>How to make <strong>Lasagna</strong></h2>

    <p>Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce).</p>

    The required ingredients are:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>dried sheets of pasta</li>
        <li>rich meat ragu</li>
        <li>ricotta</li>
        <li>mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole.<br> Here's the run-down:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
    </ol>
